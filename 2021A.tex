\title{Analysis and Prediction of Fungi Decomposition Process}

\begin{document}

	\begin{abstract}
		Fungi play an indespensable role in the carbon cycle of our ecosystems. They free the trapped carbon in the debri of living creatures out into the cycle through metabolism. Environment for fungi's well-living is delicate. Any turbulence of temoerature, humidity, and the competition from within the populations would bring pressure to the fungal reproducction.
		
		First of all, we assume that the only resources, the woody fibres, are infinite, thus build a mathematical model using N-species CLV equations to describe the growth of fungi populationj without limit of population capacity. To build the model we assume some of the paramaters of the growth of fungi. The model demostrates that.
		
		In the second step, we take the limitation of woody fibres into account, and adjust Model1 to fit the new population model. The new model showa that 123.

		
		
		In addition, we test the minggandu and robustness\\
